# Typingspeed_tester

A Typing Speed Tester project is a simple application designed to measure and enhance typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with a passage or set of words to type within a specified time. The tool records metrics such as words per minute (WPM), typing accuracy (percentage of correctly typed characters), and error rates.
